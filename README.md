# libopenmpt_py

Python bindings for libopenmpt. Libopenmpt is a "cross-platform C++ and C library to decode tracked music files".
The docs can be found here: <https://lib.openmpt.org/doc/>
The bindings are based on the documentation here specifically: <https://lib.openmpt.org/doc/group__libopenmpt__c.html>.

Better documentation (and examples) soon, I hope. :p
